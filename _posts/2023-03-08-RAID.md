# RAID1
- RAID 1 uses the concept of data mirroring

# RAID 4
- RAID 4 stripes the data across multiple disks just like RAID 0. In addition to that, it also stores parity information of all the disks in a separate dedicated disk to achieve

# RAID 5 
- RAID 5 is very similar to RAID 4, but here the parity information is distributed over all the disks instead of storing them in a dedicated disk.

# RAID 6
- RAID 6 uses double parity blocks to achieve better data redundancy than RAID 5.

# RAID 1+0
- RAID 10 combines both RAID 1 and RAID 0 by layering them in opposite order. Sometimes, it is also called as “nested” or “hybrid” RAID.
