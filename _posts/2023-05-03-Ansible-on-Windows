With Ansible on Windows, you can perform many tasks like deployments, managing windows servers, execute powershell scripts. 
In this post we are going to connect to Windows Server 2022 from Ansible controller running ubuntu18 over WinRM

# Setting up WinRM listener on Windows 

Run commands below to upgrade powershell and .net framework
```
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jborean93/ansible-windows/master/scripts/Upgrade-PowerShell.ps1"
$file = "$env:temp\Upgrade-PowerShell.ps1"
$username = "vagrant"
$password = "vagrant"
(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
&$file -Version 5.1 -Username $username -Password $password -Verbose
```

Download and Run the script below to configure WinRM
```
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
$file = "$env:temp\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file
winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener
```

Set winrm to allow HTTP Traffic

` winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}' `

Set authentication to basic

` winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}' `

# Configure Ansible Controller

Install pywinrm python module

` pip3 install pywinrm `

Now, Update the Host file to add Windows server IP address

[win]
192.168.0.100

Define few required variables Ansible will use to connect to Windows hosts 
```
mkdir /etc/ansible/groups_vars
touch /etc/ansible/group_vard/win.yml
chmod -R 777 /etc/ansible
```

Add below lines in win.yml file
```
---
ansible_user: vagrant
ansible_password: vagrant
ansible_connection: winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
ansible_winrm_transport: basic
ansible_winrm_port: 5985
```

# Test Connectivity

` ansible win -m win_ping `

Run command above and you should get response below
```
192.168.0.100 | SUCCESS => {

"changed": false,
"ping": "pong"
}
```
