title: What is umask ?
category: [LINUX, OS]
---

When creating a new file or directory linux applies default set of permissions. umask commands lets you change default permissions
Who does it apply to ? 
Owner, Group and Others just like permissions
How to view ? 
```bash
umask 
umask -S  # Displays current mask as symbolic value
umask -p  # Displays current mask value with prefix umask
```

# How to calculate umask value ? 
* umask value is calculated by subtracting umask value from default permissions
* System default value permissions are 777(rwxrwxrwx) for folders and 666?(rw-rw-rw-) for files
* Default mask for non-root user is 002 changing folder permissions to 775(rwxrwxr-x) and file permissions to 664 (rw-rw-r--)
* Default mask for root user is 022, changing folder permissions to 755(rwxr-xr-x) and file permissions to 644 (rw-r--r--)

# How to change umask value ? 
* non-persistent = # umask 0022
* Persistent = add a line umask 0022 to any of the file below

```bash
vi  ~/.bash_profile # for individual user
vi /etc/bashrc  # systemwide interactive and noninteractive shell ( e.g console, vnc )
vi /etc/profile # systemwide interactive shell
```
                                                                      
**Note:** When files are copied or created via ssh, it uses default mask to apply permissions for  a new file . If -P flag is used then it will use local permissions.
